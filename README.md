# CS253-Course-Project (CAMPUS CRAVES)

The “Campus Craves” application allows the digitization of grocery stores and canteens on the IIT Kanpur campus. Canteen and store owners can use the app to advertise their goods, services and menu options online. The online application allows students and campus residents to conveniently make orders online as long as they can access a web browser. In addition, it helps store and canteen owners take and manage orders, keep tabs on stocks, and gain access to some sales information.
